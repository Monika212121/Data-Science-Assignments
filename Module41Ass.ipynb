        "1. Mean (Average): The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. It gives an overall average and is most useful for data that is symmetrically distributed without extreme outliers.\n",
        "Usage: The mean is used to understand the \"central\" value of a dataset. For example, calculating the average income of a group of employees provides insight into general earning levels within the organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Median: The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset, with half of the values above and half below. It is less affected by outliers than the mean.\n",
        "Usage: The median is ideal for skewed data or data with outliers. For instance, the median household income provides a more accurate representation of typical income levels than the mean when there are extreme income variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. Datasets can be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), or multimodal (multiple modes).\n",
        "Usage: The mode is useful for identifying common categories or values, especially in categorical data. For example, the mode can reveal the most popular car color among customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Measures of Variability:-\n",
        "1. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It gives a rough sense of the data's spread but can be influenced by outliers.\n",
        "Usage: The range is useful for quick insights into how spread out values are, like showing the range of ages within a group of people.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean, showing how data points are distributed around the mean.\n",
        "Usage: Variance is often used in inferential statistics to assess the degree of variability, such as in ANOVA tests comparing the variability of scores across groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Standard Deviation: Standard deviation is the square root of variance, providing an average distance of each data point from the mean. It is easier to interpret than variance since it uses the same units as the data.\n",
        "Usage: Standard deviation is widely used to understand data spread. A lower standard deviation indicates data points are close to the mean, while a higher standard deviation indicates more spread. For instance, comparing the standard deviation of exam scores across two classes reveals which class has more consistent performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR measures the range of the middle 50% of the data, calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). It is resistant to outliers.\n",
        "Usage: The IQR is valuable in box plots and helps understand the spread of data within the central portion. It’s often used in income data to understand variability while avoiding the influence of extreme values.\n"
