        "\n",
        "1.) **Improved Accuracy:** Boosting often results in higher predictive accuracy compared to individual weak learners.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.) **Flexibility:** It can be applied to various types of weak learners and is versatile for both regression and classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.) **Handles Bias and Variance:** Boosting reduces both bias (by focusing on misclassified data) and variance (by averaging predictions).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.) **Feature Importance:** Algorithms like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting provide feature importance scores, which are helpful for feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.) **Resilient to Overfitting (to an extent):** Boosting, when regularized properly, is less likely to overfit, especially when using algorithms like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.) **Sensitive to Noise:** Boosting can overfit noisy data because it focuses heavily on misclassified points, even if they are outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.) **Computationally Expensive:** Boosting is iterative and requires training multiple models sequentially, which can be time-consuming.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.) **Requires Careful Tuning:** Boosting algorithms often need hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.) **Not Suitable for Large Datasets Without Optimization:** Due to its sequential nature, boosting can struggle with extremely large datasets unless optimized versions like XGBoost are used.\n"
